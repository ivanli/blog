The [Auckland Software Leaders Group][meetup-1] held a meetup about Product Management --- what a product manager
needs to be doing and what they should be influencing. These are my takeaway notes from the meetup.

The presentation covered 3 roles typically heard about in product management: Head of product, product manager, and
product owner. To differentiate between them: 

+ Head of product
+ Product manager
+ Product owner

Product management encompasses the responsibilities that these 3 roles have.

## Why Product Management?

Companies building products needs to be building the right product for customers. This is where a product manager comes
in: they are in service to the product team to ensure that right product is being delivered. I've interpreted this to
mean that they're the strategist for the product. 

Naturally, they're accountable for the success of the product.
