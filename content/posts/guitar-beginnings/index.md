I'm super excited to start on this journey to learn to play the guitar. This
will be the first music instrument since the end of high school - almost 13
years ago.

This won't be the first time I've picked up the guitar. I started learning it
when I was at intermediate school. Though the memories are vague and I would
probably need to start all over again.

## Why Guitar?

In recent years, my cup of tea when it comes to music has gravitated towards
acoustic guitar music - especially [unplugged versions of pop
songs][spotify-acoustic-covers]. I find there's so much more soul and feeling
when someone sings to an acoustic music when compared to regular pop music.

I find pure acoustic music (without any vocals) is such a great tool for
concentration. I gives me an instant boost in flow while doing any sort of
programminng or writing (in fact, I'm listening to it as I'm writing this).
It's on par with listening to sitting in a cafe and I've often combined the two
together.

Also, another reason is it's versatile in many ways. The complexity ranges
from simple strumming and chords to lightning fast finger picking and solos.
It's such a wide range to explore! Another dimension to versatility is the
type of music it can play. One of my end goals is to be able to join others
in playing and creating music, and I feel guitar gives me a great deal of
flexibility to do that.

## My Goals

- To be playing and creating music with a bunch of music folks (and meet some
new people along the way)!
- To be able to play in front of friends and create a relaxed and happy mood
at gatherings.

I love the idea of playing with others, creating and enjoying music together.
I'm not sure how long it's going to take to get here but it's something I'll
be exploring.

## Learning Resources

Guitar basics and skills:

- [Choosing your first guitar][jg-first-guitar] - Learning a new skill will
always be hard and there will be failures. So it's wise to reduce that as
much as possible. The easiest guitar to pick up and play is electric (because
of it's low action). Also, I wouldn't spend too much time comparing one
guitar to another because all of them can do the job.
- [Other lessons from JustinGuitar][justin-guitar] - Justin's a great guy
that makes these easy to follow videos on any skill you need to learn as a
beginner. I'll be following his lessons at the start.
