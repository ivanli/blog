[KanbanFor1][kanban-for-one] is a personal time management tool I've been using for a while now. I thought I'd share the learnings I've
gained into the way that works best for me.

## It's good at getting me focussed

No matter what technique you use, managing your focus is an activity that requires a lot of discipline. For
me, being able to stay focussed on one task gave me the biggest boost in productivity. 

Just to highlight the difference, on a day where I stick to the Kanban way, I can typically finish 5 out of 6 tasks I
set out to do. Whereas if I drop this practice and just get stuck into working, the day flies by with only 1 or 2 tasks
completed.

The biggest insight I gained was that I needed to be really clear on the end goal or state of the task. If I have that
in mind, then the goal seems to come around automatically. For example, when writing this article, I wrote the task as
'Write a 500 word blog article to share my learnings' rather than just 'Write a blog article'.

Having this clear goal helps me to stay on writing, rather than tweaking words to make it sound perfect.

## It's good at prioritising

Taking the time to think about what I plan to achieve that day sets the day into motion. With a solidly planned day, I'm
able to assess the distractions that come my way and decide whether I should take them on right now. 

If I don't take them immediately, I can drop them onto the board so I won't forget it later on. This immeidately puts
the worry that "it'll be forgotten" at bay.

Knowing the immediate value I'm adding also give a great amount of motivation to get things done and completed.

## It feels rewarding

Those of you who've done scrum / kanban would know that moving a task from in-progress to done is so satisfying. I feel
KanbanFor1 re-creates this feeling more frequently, giving you a really positive sense to your day. Maybe it's this
positive feedback that makes me work so much better.

## Example

Here's a snapshot of my KanbanFor1 board at work. It's blurred out the actual tasks but you can get the sense of what
it's about. Admittedly there's a lot of tasks in the `WAITING` state, which probably means I should retrospect on how I
can get them moving to done faster.
