> This post is a WIP.

I don't claim to have a whole deal of experience with this concept, it's a new area I'm exploring with other colleagues 
at work. Certainly it's been game changing even just reflecting on how I'm approaching ownership, where it begins and 
where it ends.

The concept of extreme ownership comes from the [book written by Jocko Willink][intro-1] --- former US Navy SEAL leader. 
I'm currently going through this with others in a book club style, so this post will be updated as I learn more.

## Why Extreme?

The idea of taking extreme ownership was radical even to the Navy SEAL. From the primitive remains of our human brain,
there's a natural tendency to protect what you have, from the fear of losing it. In every day environments, this 
translates to protecting your status and other's perception of you. 

This is what we term as 'ego', and this sometimes kicks up even when there isn't actually any real threats. 

Taking the stance of 'extreme' means to break that habit of letting our primitive tendency to take over and decide our
actions.

## And Ownership?

Taking ownership to something means caring deeply about it's outcome. It's a form of commitment --- to own something is
to be committed on doing the best to ensure it reaches the desired outcome.
           
Taking ownership to the extreme is about consciously putting aside any 

It completely removes the time and energy spent in finding the answer to "who's responsible?". It shifts the focus onto 
"I've got responsibility on this" and changes the thinking to "how am I committed to making this work out?"
