This will be the first music instrument since the end of high school - almost 13 years ago.
This won&amp;rsquo;t be the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up the guitar. I started learning it when I was at intermediate school. Though the memories are vague and I would probably need to start all over again.
Why Guitar? In recent years, my cup of tea when it comes to music has gravitated towards acoustic guitar music - especially unplugged versions of pop songs.</description></item></channel></rss>
