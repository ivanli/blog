      <description>Team startup has been on the fore-front of my mind lately because we&amp;rsquo;re just about to go through a re-structure. Sitting over a coffee, I took some time to think about what sort of team I really want to be part of and create. It really wasn&amp;rsquo;t a difficult choice: a world-class team that could tackle any challenges thrown their way.
A team like this would be a well-oiled learning and discovery machine.</description>
