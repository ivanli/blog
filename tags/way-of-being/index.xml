I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to have a whole deal of experience with this concept, it&amp;rsquo;s a new area I&amp;rsquo;m exploring with other colleagues at work. Certainly it&amp;rsquo;s been game changing even just reflecting on how I&amp;rsquo;m approaching ownership, where it begins and where it ends.
The concept of extreme ownership comes from the book written by Jocko Willink &amp;mdash; former US Navy SEAL leader. I&amp;rsquo;m currently going through this with others in a book club style, so this post will be updated as I learn more.</description></item><item><title>Read my README</title><link>https://iky.li/posts/read-my-readme/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ivan@iky.li (Ivan Li)</author><guid>https://iky.li/posts/read-my-readme/</guid><description>This README is a documentation of me. You can get a good gist of what I do and what I&amp;rsquo;m here to achieve in the F&amp;amp;P CPAP software team.
Important: NOT a replacement for actually getting to know each other more.
My Job I&amp;rsquo;m the outcome owner for DevOps sub-team in the CPAP software team. This means I&amp;rsquo;m ultimately accountable for the development and release processes adopted for the 3 sub-teams.</description></item></channel></rss>
